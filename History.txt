Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 10

12/19/2004:

1. New Vortex Tracker II v1.0 PT3 player for ZX Spectrum Release 6 is supported.

01/02/2005:

2. Max length of pattern is 100 lines now. It is compatible with all players
   (on ZX, PC and ST). Don't recompile such modules in original ZX Spectrum
   PT3 editors (there are 64 lines max).

01/03/2005:

3. Undesired area selection during autostep was removed.
4. Highligt step for tracks' lines can be adjusted now. If Auto is on, step is
   autoselected from 3,4 and 5 depending of pattern length (specially for
   Key-Jee).

01/04/2005:

5. Added checking of module size during saving (compiling) PT3 format. If size
   is greater than 65536, error message will appear. If it is, save module in
   text format and than try to solve the problem. Alone Coder proposes to split
   it to several small modules and then play it one by other. So, you can load
   module in several windows, remove some data and save them with different
   names.
6. Added checking of block size during export to ZX-formats.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 11

04/23/2005:

1. Added Amadeus (Fuxoft AY Language) modules import. Both FXM and ZXAYAMAD are
   supported. The most modules require manual editing, but sounds good and
   without it.

04/24/2005:

2. Memory for patterns/samples/ornaments are static now, i.e. you can decrease
   and increase its length without losting last lines previous values.
3. Fixed error: fault when trying to play empty (default) pattern by F7/F8.
4. Patterns/samples/ornaments length can be changed during playing now.

04/26/2005:

5. Maximal length of pattern is 256 lines now. To keep 2 columns line numeration
   it is hexadecimal now.

05/01/2005:

6. Undo/Redo functions are added. Try to test and send me bugreports or wishes.

05/04/2005:

7. Due HalfElf's request, added ability to load modules into editor from command
   line. Several files must be divided by spaces, and filenames with spaces must
   be placed to doublequotes.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 12

05/29/2005:

1. Fixed error in PT2 importer: memory before sample import was not clear.

06/14/2005:

2. Fixed horrible mistake: if you open save or some other dialogs during playing
   in "Loop among all opened modules" and next window start playing before you
   will finish, dialog will work with new active window. From this version
   all dialogs work with window, which was active during calling dialog.
   
09/16/2005:

3. Added import of PSC v1.00-1.03 modules.

09/30/2005:

4. Added import of compiled PSM (Pro Sound Maker by Denis Dratov) modules. They
   must be compiled by original (author's) compiler.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 13

10/02/2005:

1. Fixed error in PSM import: loop position always was zero.

03/14/2006:

2. In addition to 'Save As...' command added simple 'Save' (asks for file name
   only for new modules).
3. Added save requests before closing module windows or whole editor.

03/16/2006:

4. Added second sound chip emulation to play any two opened modules
   simultaneously. 'Play' and 'Play from start' start playing module of current
   window through the first chip and module selected in dropdown list of control
   panel through the second chip. So, you can edit two standard PT3-modules, and
   then play it simultaneously through some of known devices (Turbo-Sound or
   Turbo-AY) on real ZX (see example in ZX-magazine InfoGuide #8).

03/18/2006:

5. MC68000 PT3-player is updated (SNDH-export). Note and volume tables are
   packed now via Ivan Roshin methods (player size is 1 KB smaller now).
6. SNDH-export is improved: new SNDH v2 TAGs are supported and new file name
   extension (SNDH) is used now.

03/19/2006:

7. 'Options' dialog allows you to input any AY-frequency in range 1-3.5 MHz, and
   any player frequency in range 1-2000 Hz.
8. Added track colors selection in 'Options' dialog.

03/25/2006:

9. Fixed tracks editor's cursor moving errors (PageUp/PageDown reaction).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 14

10/01/2006:

1. Window for 2nd chip is autoselected during changing module window. No need to
   select it manually now (if you are editing only two modules in TS mode, of
   course).
2. During playing in TS mode tracks moving of both windows are sinchronized now.
3. During editing in TS mode tracks and cursors of both windows are sinchronized
   too.
4. In TS mode cursor moving to the maximum right or left position of tracks
   editor will activate window of 2nd chip in same position of tracks editor.
5. "Play from position" function (F5) works from current cursor position now.

10/03/2006:

6. Fixed bug: envelope period changed in AutoEnv mode was not added to the undo
   list (thanks to Karbofos for bug-report).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 15

03/04/2007:

1. Module window is redesigned for more comfortable editing in TS mode (thanks
   to Znahar for ideas and help).
2. No need to close Tracks Manager window now, it stays on top and works with
   current module, which name is duplicated in main window title (specially for
   (Znahar).

03/08/2007:

3. Selected track area can be transposed by calling pop-up menu or from keyboard
   (Num +, Num -, Ctrl+Num +, Ctrl+Num - (+-semiton/+-octave). New function
   works with notes and envelope track.
4. Fixed error: after using AutoStep current time was not updated.
5. AutoStep works after pasting from clipboard now (specially for TAD).
6. Fixed error: trying to start playing of just created (empty) module in TS
   mode rised error message (thanks to Znahar for bug-report).
7. AutoStep can be used with insert/delete/clear track/pattern line. Can be
   useful for increasing/decreasing pattern size twice (thanks to TAD for idea).
8. Fixed error: the most Undo/Redo operations not updated module duration info.
9. Fixed error: after insert/delete/clear track/pattern line module duration and
   current time info was not updated.

03/10/2007:

10. Some Znahar's ideas was added: Global Transposition window can be always
    opened; the most buttons of tools panel can be removed via pop-up menu; size
    and position of main window is saved during closing.
11. Fixed error: if envelopes in channel is disabled in Editor Controls, you can
    hear tone and noise if they enabled in sample now (thanks to TAD for bug-
    report and test module).
12. You can input -96 and +96 numbers in ornament editor (works like 95, but -96
    is used in many PT3-modules from ZX Spectrum). Thanks to TAD for info.

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 16

04/30/2007:

1. New Release 7 of ZX player is used for exporting. New version allows right
   work of 1.xx and 2.xx special commands for PT 3.7 modules.

   converted to two single PT3-modules).

05/01/2007:

3. Fixed bug: during playing module VT didn't alow to change position value in
   other module windows.
4. Fixed loading modules bug: not used lines of pattern was not cleared, and
   after increasing pattern length random trash can be shown in last lines.
5. Some PT 3.6 structure analizer was added to prompt user about loading PT 3.6
   modules as Turbo Sound.
6. Added PT 3.7 editor mode, which allows to use special commands 1.xx and 2.xx
   to single change tone frequency by xx value down or up.
7. 3xxx interpretation type option changed to Features level selection:
   ProTracker 3.5, Vortex Tracker II (PT 3.6) and ProTracker 3.7. Each mode
   marked in module by own header.
8. Some redesign of pattern editor window (specially for ch41ns4w).
9. Highlight step can be 0 now (same as 256 and same as 'no highlight' option,
   specially for TAD).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 17

1. TS-mode is turning on after loading TS-module. If only two windows are opened
   they are tiling horizontally also.
2. Added new TS-format loader (used in Ay_Emul 2.9 beta 2).
3. Changed 2nd module pointing method for TS-mode. Now you can point one window
   two another individually.
4. Again redesign of pattern editor window (specially for Ch41ns4w).

05/18/2007:

5. During saving one of module in TS-mode, 2nd module is added to result file
   too. In text format modules fallow one for another, so you can merge two
   single modules without editor in command line:

     copy Module1.txt+Module2.txt Module.txt.

   During saving PT3 16 bytes identifer is added at the end of result file. More
   simplier to save it from editor, but you still do same in command line:

     copy/b Module1.pt3+Module2.pt3+ID Module.pt3

   where ID is next structure file:
    +0 Str4 'PT3!'
    +4 Word Module1.pt3 file size
    +6 Str4 'PT3!'
    +A Word Module2.pt3 file size
    +C Str4 '02TS'
6. AutoStep range is expanded to +-256.
7. Fixed error: in no loop mode more short module of TS-pair plays first tick of
   loop position before stopping.
8. Fixed error: color text on some buttons was set to black instead of system
   window text color (thanks to Roman Kuraev for bug-report)..

05/19/2007:

9. Added new TS-player for ZX exporting of TS-modules. Don't forget to load in
   DE register address of second module.
10.Max size of ornament is upped to 255 (old 64 lines limitations was only in
   ZX Spectrum editor, not in players). New size limit allows to import long 
   ornaments from ASC and PSC modules.
11.PSC-files import is improved (see guitar.psc by Mast).

Vortex Tracker II v1.0 beta 18

11/20/2008:

1. Tracks redrawing moved from additional to main thread via windows messages
   for more safe and stable work (but without measured moving warranty).
2. Specially for TAD new tool "Toggle samples" (Ctrl+M) was made (seek at Play
   menu or on tool panel). Tool allows to mute sound of any samples to hear/mute
   standalone parties of composition (drum, main theme, echo, etc).
3. Due many requests channel numbers in Track Manager are literal now (A, B and
   C). In type field can be input numbers from 0 to 2 as usually.

11/22/2008:

4. Specially for TAD added Shift+Backspace shortcut to do step backward if
   AutoStep is on.
5. Serious bug was found: if new typed value is equal to existing one, change
   is not added to Undo, but numbers of line and channel stored somewhere (if
   first change than can be access violation, if not first - in previous action,
   that's not good too). Fixed.

11/24/2008:

6. Especially for TAD after changing pattern number or activating module window
   its number is copied to Tracks Manager and Global Transposition windows.
7. In input pattern size field you can press PageUp and PageDown to increase/
   decrease pattern size with highlight step value (for TAD).
8. You can select position in OrderList of 2nd window during playing in Turbo
   Sound mode to restart playing from.
9. Pop-up menu or keys / and * on numpad allows to compress/expand pattern size
   by 2 times (specially for TAD). Just set new speed to keep tempo after
   operation if you need.

11/25/2008:

10.Due Roman Kuraev request added new function Merge (Ctrl+Alt+V or pop-up menu)
   to Paste from clipboard without erasing existing pattern data with empty
   values. Can be useful for making echo or inserting 2nd party between notes of
   main party.
11.Copy of Tracks Manager is added to Undo, but all previous Undo actions is
   cleared. Fixed.
12.Due TAD request, all operations of Tracks Manager can exceed patterns size up
   to maximum pattern length (256) if work lines number allows. This feature
   allows you to increase pattern size after operation.
13.Fixed old error in ZX player export: bad player relocation for some address
   (for example, B1DD for TS-player) due carry ignoring when low byte of address
   is bigger than some value.

11/26/2008:

14.For TAD editing 1st module in TS-mode makes available Save button (and query
   for saving before closing) after switching to 2nd module even if it is not
   edited yet.

4. More perfect AY emulation engine from Ay_Emul 2.9 beta 31.
5. Options are stored in VT.cfg now (like Ay_Emul in home folder of current
   user, or in VT executable folder, if you move it or create empty yourself).
6. STC loader can extract author' strings from 'KSA SOFTWARE COMPILATION OF '
   and 'SOUND TRACKER COMPILATION OF ', insterted in Ay_Emul methodic.
